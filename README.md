# Advent of Code __2015__ JS
--------------------

## Rationale
To whom it may concern; hopefully that's you ȏ.̮ȏ,

I've created this repository so that you could begin learning Javascript and code along with a known(and fun) problem set. This is last years AdventOfCode. I've decided this would be ideal as to not ruin this years [Advent](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1) and would provide for you a wealth of Reddit threads to pull from if you were to get stuck.

## Instructions
> This tutorial assumes you have a fairly
recent version of NodeJS and NPM on your machine.
If not, head over to [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and get you some. :)

1. Clone this repo.
2. `cd` into the given day's directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` or for you impatient folks, `npm i`(they are the same command).
4. To ensure things are working as expected run the command  `npm run test`, this command runs our test suite.

#### A note about the syntax.
We will be using [ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) wherever possible, this is the latest and greatest JS, this ain't your momma's Javascript. In fact, most modern browsers (i.e. Google Chrome, Firefox) have already adopted many of the features we will be using. We will enable some more cutting edge syntax thanks to [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/).

Happy coding ( °-°)シ ミ★ ミ☆.
